<p>The Brethren of John J. Mercer Lodge No. 290 believe that while there are many different paths a Freemason may follow – educational, ritual, community, philanthropy, etc. – the best way to observe the Craft is through a Brotherhood focused on learning and understanding our ritual and then applying its teachings to ourselves and to the communities in which we live.</p>
<p>To that end, Mercer places a strong emphasis on tangible Masonic education and are purposeful in the selection of candidates to join us in this great and good work. In order to effectively describe this group of Freemasons, the term “Mercer Man” or “Mercer Men” was coined with the simple aim of “travelling upon the level” in all our Masonic practices.</p>
<p>The Lodge’s namesake, John Jackson (J.) Mercer, was Grand Master of Nebraska in 1890. Mercer said that lodges who devote time to perfecting ritual “are the ones whose members are those with whom the burdened heart may pour out its sorrows and to whom distress may proffer its suit with the best prospect of receiving a favorable answer.”</p>
<p>Agreed.</p>
<h2 class="has-text-align-center" id="community">COMMUNITY</h2>
<p>John J. Mercer Lodge No. 290, as owner of the Benson Masonic Temple, in the Creative District of Benson (Omaha, NE), has grown to be a staple in their local community.</p>
<p>The “Mercer Men” have partnered with Benson First Friday (BFF) on numerous occasions. More recently developing a partnership to open their dining hall to BFF for the Artist Markets to continue in the winter time. During these First Fridays, the Mercer Men hand-make breakfast burritos and sell them to customers of BFF, patrons, and passersby as a fundraiser for the Lodge to help maintain the building, maintenance and utility costs.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
