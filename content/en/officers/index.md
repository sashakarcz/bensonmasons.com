| Bro. Celio received the Grand Master’s Proficiency coins for Full-Form Proficiency Excellence in 2019-20 and earned his Individual Proficiency in 2021. Celio often helps the Brethren find beauty in our ritual and light in our teachings of the Craft.| | Bro. Mark brings an air of pragmatism to Mercer. Mark ensures the Lodge building, as well as the Brethren are well cared-for and is often quick to offer his assistance to anyone in distress. Mark is a role model to us all in the way he gives of himself without request. |

|WB Brent recently joined John J. Mercer Lodge No. 290 from Charity Zeredatha Lodge No. 189 in St. Joseph, MO where he served as Worshipful Master in 2004-05. Brent immediately dove into various projects at Mercer, sharing his expertise, time and talents creating a stronger masonic community. Brent also traveled with the Mercer Men to the 2023 Annual Communication before being an officer.| | WB John Dimon is a trusted mentor (often being called “The Professor”) to the Mercer Men. John was appointed a Deputy Grand Custodian in 2018 and is often there with quiet, stoic words of wisdom or a joke that isn’t caught until later…usually giving the brethren a hearty laugh. WB John’s unwavering support of Mercer helps keep the Brethren all focused on doing what’s right for the Fraternity. |
