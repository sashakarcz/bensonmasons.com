Michael was raised at John J. Mercer Lodge in 2014. Bro. Barnes was awarded the Titanium Trowel in 2021 after a brief hiatus, thus returning to become an active and integral part of Mercer. Michael’s dedication to preserving the reputation of the Fraternity is cherished by its Brethren.

Bro. Celio received the Grand Master’s Proficiency coins for Full-Form Proficiency Excellence in 2019-20 and earned his Individual Proficiency in 2021. Celio often helps the Brethren find beauty in our ritual and light in our teachings of the Craft.


### Junior Warden

Bro. Mark brings an air of pragmatism to Mercer. Mark ensures the Lodge building, as well as the Brethren are well cared-for and is often quick to offer his assistance to anyone in distress. Mark is a role model to us all in the way he gives of himself without request.



### Secretary

WB Brent recently joined John J. Mercer Lodge No. 290 from Charity Zeredatha Lodge No. 189 in St. Joseph, MO where he served as Worshipful Master in 2004-05. Brent immediately dove into various projects at Mercer, sharing his expertise, time and talents creating a stronger masonic community. Brent also traveled with the Mercer Men to the 2023 Annual Communication before being an officer.

### Treasurer

WB John Dimon is a trusted mentor (often being called “The Professor”) to the Mercer Men. John was appointed a Deputy Grand Custodian in 2018 and is often there with quiet, stoic words of wisdom or a joke that isn’t caught until later…usually giving the brethren a hearty laugh. WB John’s unwavering support of Mercer helps keep the Brethren all focused on doing what’s right for the Fraternity.



### Senior Deacon

Bro. Ethan is one of the newest Master Masons, being recently Raised in December 2023. Ethan has had an impressive Masonic resume after only one year.

Bro. Julius was Raised at Mercer in 2010. After having been inactive at the lodge for over a decade, Julius came by the Lodge one night, put on an apron to see a degree and became part of the officer corps, being appointed Junior Steward Pro-Tem in 2023. Julius recently earned the Titanium Trowel Award for his efforts in getting active again.
